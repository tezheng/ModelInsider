"""
Security Test Suite

This module tests security aspects of the modelexport system to ensure
robust handling of malicious inputs, path traversal attacks, and other
security vulnerabilities.

CARDINAL RULES:
- MUST-001: NO HARDCODED LOGIC - Security tests must be universal
- MUST-002: TORCH.NN FILTERING - Validate security across all architectures
- MUST-003: UNIVERSAL DESIGN - Security measures work for any model type

Security Test Categories:
1. Path Validation - Directory traversal, symlink attacks
2. Input Sanitization - Malicious model inputs, ONNX files
3. File System Security - Permissions, access controls
4. Model Validation - Malicious PyTorch models
5. Resource Protection - Memory/CPU exhaustion attacks
