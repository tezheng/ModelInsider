## Context and Problem Statement

The ModelExport framework is a complex system involving multiple export strategies, optimization frameworks, and universal design principles. As the project evolves, architectural decisions need to be documented to:

- Provide context for future development decisions
- Help new team members understand design rationales
- Track the evolution of architectural choices
- Prevent repeated discussions of settled issues
- Enable better decision-making through documented trade-offs

Currently, design decisions are scattered across various markdown files without a consistent structure or decision-tracking process.

## Decision Drivers

- **Knowledge Management**: Need to capture and preserve architectural decisions
- **Team Coordination**: Multiple developers need to understand design rationales
- **Future Maintenance**: Decisions need context for future modifications
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Clear documentation of trade-offs and consequences
- **Process Consistency**: Standardized approach to documenting decisions

## Considered Options

1. **Informal documentation** - Continue with ad-hoc design documents
2. **Confluence/Wiki pages** - Use external documentation platform
3. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** - Structured markdown documents in repository
4. **Code comments only** - Document decisions directly in code

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) - Structured markdown documents in repository

### Rationale

ADRs provide the best balance of structure, accessibility, and version control integration. They:

- Live alongside the code in the same repository
- Use a consistent template for decision documentation
- Are version-controlled and track changes over time
- Can be referenced in pull requests and issues
- Follow industry best practices for architectural documentation

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Structured approach to documenting architectural decisions
- Better knowledge transfer and onboarding
- Clear audit trail of design evolution
- Improved decision-making through forced analysis of trade-offs
- Industry-standard approach familiar to most developers

**Negative:**
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Need to maintain discipline in keeping ADRs updated
- Potential for ADRs to become outdated if not maintained

**Neutral:**
- Learning curve for ADR format and process
- Need to establish process for ADR review and approval

## Implementation Notes

### ADR Process

1. **Create ADR**: Use the provided template for new architectural decisions
2. **Number sequentially**: ADR-001, ADR-002, etc. with leading zeros
3. **Review process**: ADRs should be reviewed like code changes
4. **Status tracking**: Update status as decisions evolve
5. **Location**: Store in `docs/design/` directory

### ADR Template

Use the provided `adr-template.md` for consistency across all architectural decisions.

### Naming Convention

- Format: `ADR-{number}-{short-descriptive-title}.md`
- Example: `ADR-002-auxiliary-operations-tagging.md`
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Keep titles concise (40-50 characters)

### Status Lifecycle

- **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision has been made and approved
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer applicable but maintained for historical context
- **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR (reference the replacement)

## Validation/Confirmation

Success will be measured by:
- Consistent use of ADR format for all architectural decisions
- Improved onboarding experience for new team members
- Reduced time spent re-discussing settled architectural issues
- Better context available for future architectural decisions

## Detailed Analysis of Options

### Option 1: Informal documentation
- **Description**: Continue with current ad-hoc approach using various markdown files
- **Pros**: 
  - No process overhead
  - Flexible format
- **Cons**: 
  - Inconsistent structure
  - Difficult to find and reference decisions
  - No clear decision tracking
- **Technical Impact**: No immediate changes required but long-term maintenance issues

### Option 2: Confluence/Wiki pages
- **Description**: Use external documentation platform for architectural decisions
- **Pros**: 
  - Rich formatting options
  - Good search capabilities
  - Comment and review features
- **Cons**: 
  - Separate from code repository
  - Additional tool to maintain
  - Not version-controlled with code
- **Technical Impact**: Would require setting up external documentation platform

### Option 3: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- **Description**: Structured markdown documents in repository using industry-standard format
- **Pros**: 
  - Version-controlled with code
  - Consistent structure
  - Industry best practice
  - Easy to reference and link
- **Cons**: 
  - Requires process discipline
  - Additional documentation overhead
- **Technical Impact**: Need to establish template and process

### Option 4: Code comments only
- **Description**: Document architectural decisions directly in code as detailed comments
- **Pros**: 
  - Close to implementation
  - Always visible to developers
- **Cons**: 
  - Not suitable for high-level architectural decisions
  - Difficult to get overview of all decisions
  - Limited formatting options
- **Technical Impact**: No structured approach, decisions scattered across codebase
