# Refactoring Guidelines & Best Practices

## Overview

This document provides systematic guidelines for refactoring Python code, based on real-world experience with the HTP Export Monitor refactoring. These practices ensure maintainable, universal, and high-quality code.

## üö® MANDATORY RULES (Zero Tolerance)

### Rule 1: No Hardcoded Logic
- **NEVER** hardcode model names, architectures, node names, or operation names
- **ALWAYS** use universal approaches (PyTorch `nn.Module` hierarchy, forward hooks)
- **BEFORE** every commit: Ask "Is this hardcoded to any specific architecture?"
- **VALIDATION**: Search codebase for model-specific strings before any release

### Rule 2: Ruff Lint Compliance
- **ALWAYS** run `ruff check` after code changes
- **FIX** all linting issues before committing
- **ZERO** tolerance for new linting violations
- **ENFORCE** via pre-commit hooks where possible

### Rule 3: No Regression Testing
- **ALWAYS** run full test suite after refactoring: `uv run pytest tests/`
- **VERIFY** all tests pass before marking tasks complete
- **UPDATE** test assertions to match refactored structure
- **MAINTAIN** backward compatibility unless explicitly breaking

## üìã Pre-Refactoring Checklist

### Assessment Phase
- [ ] Identify all hardcoded values (magic numbers, strings, constants)
- [ ] Locate duplicated code patterns and logic
- [ ] Review large methods that need decomposition
- [ ] Check for missing error handling
- [ ] Assess test coverage and compatibility
- [ ] Run `ruff check` to identify existing issues

### Planning Phase
- [ ] Create Config class structure for constants
- [ ] Plan utility method signatures for common operations
- [ ] Design method decomposition strategy
- [ ] Plan error handling approach
- [ ] Identify type safety improvements needed

## üîß Refactoring Implementation Guide

### 1. Configuration Management
**Objective**: Centralize all magic values and constants

**Steps**:
- [ ] Create `Config` class with logical groupings:
  ```python
  class Config:
      # Display settings
      TOP_NODES_COUNT = 20
      SEPARATOR_LENGTH = 80
      
      # Console settings
      CONSOLE_WIDTH = 120
      
      # File suffixes
      METADATA_SUFFIX = "_htp_metadata.json"
      
      # Numeric constants
      MILLION = 1e6
      PERCENT = 100.0
  ```
- [ ] Replace all hardcoded values with `Config.CONSTANT_NAME`
- [ ] Group related constants together
- [ ] Use descriptive names that explain purpose
- [ ] Document purpose of each constant group

### 2. Code Deduplication
**Objective**: Extract repeated patterns into reusable utilities

**Steps**:
- [ ] Identify 3+ line code patterns that repeat
- [ ] Create utility methods with single responsibility:
  ```python
  def _create_report_console(self, file=None) -> Console:
      """Create console with consistent settings."""
      return Console(
          file=file,
          width=Config.CONSOLE_WIDTH,
          force_terminal=False,
          highlight=False
      )
  ```
- [ ] Replace all instances with utility calls
- [ ] Add proper type hints and docstrings
- [ ] Test utility methods independently

### 3. Method Decomposition
**Objective**: Break large methods into focused functions

**Steps**:
- [ ] Identify methods >50 lines or with multiple responsibilities
- [ ] Extract logical blocks into helper methods
- [ ] Use descriptive names for extracted methods
- [ ] Maintain single responsibility principle
- [ ] Add docstrings to all new methods
- [ ] Ensure proper parameter passing

### 4. Error Handling Enhancement
**Objective**: Add robust error handling with user-friendly messages

**Steps**:
- [ ] Wrap file I/O operations in try-except blocks
- [ ] Provide meaningful error messages to users
- [ ] Continue gracefully for non-critical failures
- [ ] Log errors appropriately
- [ ] Test error scenarios

### 5. Type Safety Improvements
**Objective**: Add proper type hints and fix type issues

**Steps**:
- [ ] Fix implicit Optional types: `int = None` ‚Üí `int | None = None`
- [ ] Add type hints to all method parameters and returns
- [ ] Use modern Python type syntax (`|` for unions)
- [ ] Run `mypy` if available for additional type checking

### 6. Universal Design Enforcement
**Objective**: Ensure code works with any model/architecture

**Steps**:
- [ ] Review all logic for model-specific assumptions
- [ ] Replace hardcoded names with generic PyTorch patterns
- [ ] Use `nn.Module` hierarchy and forward hooks
- [ ] Test with multiple different model architectures
- [ ] Document universal design principles used

### 7. Code Organization
**Objective**: Improve readability and maintainability

**Steps**:
- [ ] Group related methods with clear section separators:
  ```python
  # ========================================================================
  # CONFIGURATION
  # ========================================================================
  ```
- [ ] Use consistent naming conventions (snake_case)
- [ ] Maintain logical flow from initialization to cleanup
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] Remove dead code and unused imports

## ‚úÖ Post-Refactoring Validation

### Code Quality Checks
- [ ] Run `ruff check` and fix all issues
- [ ] Run `ruff format` for consistent formatting
- [ ] Verify no hardcoded model-specific logic remains
- [ ] Check all constants moved to Config class
- [ ] Ensure all utility methods have docstrings

### Testing Validation
- [ ] Run full test suite: `uv run pytest tests/ -v`
- [ ] Verify 100% test pass rate
- [ ] Update test assertions for refactored structure
- [ ] Remove references to deleted classes/methods
- [ ] Test with multiple model architectures

### Functionality Validation
- [ ] Test end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Check error handling works as expected
- [ ] Validate performance hasn't degraded
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios

## üìä Success Metrics

### Quantitative Measures
- **Constants Extracted**: Count of hardcoded values moved to Config
- **Methods Created**: Number of utility methods for deduplication
- **Method Size Reduction**: Average method line count reduction
- **Test Pass Rate**: Must remain 100%
- **Lint Issues**: Must be 0 after refactoring

### Qualitative Measures
- **Readability**: Code is easier to understand
- **Maintainability**: Changes are easier to make
- **Reusability**: Common operations are abstracted
- **Consistency**: Similar operations use same patterns
- **Documentation**: Purpose and usage is clear
