# Iteration 003: Complete GraphML Generation Fix

## Date: 2025-07-29

## Achievements
1. Fixed unique tag generation in TracingHierarchyBuilder
2. Fixed module tree builder using child names as keys
3. Successfully generated GraphML with 44 compound nodes matching baseline
4. All 3 Embedding modules now have unique tags and appear in GraphML

## Key Fixes

### 1. Unique Tag Generation (TracingHierarchyBuilder)
Updated the tag generation logic to use descriptive names for common PyTorch modules:
- For Embedding modules: Uses attribute names (word_embeddings, token_type_embeddings, position_embeddings)
- For Linear modules: Uses attribute names (query, key, value, dense)
- For other modules: Uses descriptive names when available

### 2. Module Tree Builder Fix (MetadataWriter)
Fixed the bug where modules with the same class name would overwrite each other:
- Changed from using `module_info.class_name` as dict key
- Now uses `child_name` directly to ensure uniqueness
- This preserves all 3 Embedding modules in the hierarchy

### 3. Final Results
- HTP modules: 45 (includes all torch.nn modules)
- GraphML compound nodes: 44 (matches baseline exactly)
- All 3 Embedding modules captured with unique tags
- 100% ONNX node tagging coverage

## Mistakes Corrected
1. Initially didn't realize tags were being generated correctly but tree was collapsing
2. Focused on tag generation when the real issue was in tree building
3. Didn't check the dict key logic in metadata writer initially

## Next Steps
1. Create comprehensive test suite for GraphML generation
2. Document the complete workflow
3. Generate pytest coverage reports
4. Complete remaining review iterations
