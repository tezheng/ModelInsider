## Strategy Ecosystem Analysis

### Current Strategy Landscape

#### **Three Primary Export Strategies**:

1. **HTP (Hierarchical Trace-and-Project)** - Our Enhanced Strategy
   - **Status**: Enhanced with auxiliary operations (Iterations 1-7)
   - **Strength**: 100% coverage, universal robustness, comprehensive tracing
   - **Performance**: Slower but most comprehensive (5.920s benchmark)
   - **Use Case**: Complex models, HuggingFace transformers, maximum coverage priority

2. **FX Graph Strategy**
   - **Status**: Existing, unmodified
   - **Strength**: Fast export, symbolic graph representation
   - **Limitation**: Cannot handle dynamic control flow
   - **Use Case**: Simple PyTorch models, speed priority

3. **Usage-Based Strategy (Legacy)**
   - **Status**: Existing, maintained for compatibility
   - **Strength**: Fastest performance (2.488s), maximum compatibility
   - **Use Case**: Backward compatibility, baseline comparisons

#### **Strategy Selection and Integration Infrastructure**:

- **Unified Export Interface**: `/modelexport/unified_export.py`

## Integration Validation Test Cases

### Test Case 1: **Unified Export Interface Compatibility**
```python
# Should work identically with enhanced HTP
from modelexport.unified_export import export_model_auto
result = export_model_auto(model, inputs, "output.onnx")
# Enhanced auxiliary operations should be transparent to user
```

### Test Case 2: **Strategy Selection with Auxiliary Operations**
```python
# Strategy selector should account for auxiliary operation benefits
from modelexport.core.strategy_selector import StrategySelector
selector = StrategySelector()
recommendation = selector.select_strategy(model, inputs, priority="coverage")
# Should recommend enhanced HTP for maximum coverage
```

### Test Case 3: **Fallback Integration**
```python
# Enhanced HTP should work as fallback strategy
from modelexport.unified_export import export_model_with_fallback
result = export_model_with_fallback(model, inputs, primary="fx", fallback="htp")
# Should fall back to enhanced HTP if FX fails
```

### Test Case 4: **Performance Monitoring Integration**
```python
# Performance monitoring should track auxiliary operation metrics
result = export_model_auto(model, inputs, "output.onnx", monitor_performance=True)
assert 'auxiliary_operations_coverage' in result.performance_metrics
assert 'fallback_strategy_usage' in result.performance_metrics
```
