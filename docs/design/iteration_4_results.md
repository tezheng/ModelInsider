# Iteration 4 Results

## Summary
Successfully completed all major tasks. The simplified export monitor now uses Rich library throughout, displays properly formatted output, and generates all required files.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Fixed Tree Line Wrapping
- Increased console width to 120 to avoid wrapping
- Simplified tree text building using Text object methods
- No more broken [bold cyan] tags in output

### 2. Implemented Report Writing
- Complete text report with all export details
- Plain text output (no ANSI codes)
- Includes hierarchy tree and operation counts
- Properly formatted with sections for each step

### 3. All Files Generated
- ONNX model: 17.6 MB
- Report file: 2.8 KB plain text report
- Metadata file: 23.4 KB JSON with complete export data

## Final Output Quality

### Excellent:
- ✅ Uses Rich library throughout (Tree, Text, Console)
- ✅ Clean 7-step process
- ✅ Proper ONNX operation display (Constant, Add, MatMul, etc.)
- ✅ Parameter formatting matches baseline (4.4M)
- ✅ 100% coverage calculation
- ✅ All files generated correctly
- ✅ Clean tree display without wrapping

### Remaining Minor Tasks:
- Node counts in hierarchy display (low priority)

- Proper use of Rich library components
- All ruff lint issues fixed
- Type hints throughout
- Well-documented code

## Summary of All Iterations

### Iteration 1:
- Created simplified export monitor
- Removed extra steps (7 steps only)
- Used Rich library basics

### Iteration 2:
- Replaced old monitor with simplified version
- Tested integration with HTP exporter
- Identified formatting issues

### Iteration 3:
- Fixed ONNX operation display
- Fixed parameter formatting
- Added operation counting to HTP exporter

### Iteration 4:
- Fixed tree line wrapping
