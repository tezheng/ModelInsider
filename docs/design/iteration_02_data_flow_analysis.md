# Iteration 2: Data Flow Analysis for Auxiliary Operations

**Date:** 2025-06-26  
**Goal:** Improve auxiliary operation tagging with sophisticated data flow analysis  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

## Objectives

1. **Enhanced Context Inheritance**: Implement proper producer-consumer data flow analysis
2. **Semantic Accuracy**: Assign auxiliary operations to the modules they actually support
3. **Auxiliary Classification**: Distinguish between different types of auxiliary operations
4. **Performance Validation**: Ensure no performance regression while improving accuracy

## Background from Iteration 1

âœ… **Iteration 1 Success**: Fixed critical regression - achieved 100% operation coverage
- **Root Cause Fixed**: HTP builtin tracking now calls auxiliary operations coverage
- **Fallback Strategy**: All 31 auxiliary operations tagged with most common tag
- **Graph Filtering Safe**: No more empty tag lists

âš¡ **Current Limitation**: All auxiliary operations get the same fallback tag
- Example: Both `/Shape` and `/Constant` operations get `/BertModel/Embeddings/WordEmbeddings`
- **Issue**: This doesn't reflect actual data flow relationships in the graph
- **Opportunity**: Can we assign auxiliary operations to the modules they actually support?

## Data Flow Analysis Design

### Current Auxiliary Operation Patterns (from BERT-tiny)

From the fixed export, all 31 auxiliary operations currently get tagged as:
```
/BertModel/Embeddings/WordEmbeddings
```

But analysis shows these operations support different modules:

#### Input Preprocessing Operations
- `/Shape`, `/Shape_1`, `/Shape_2` - analyze input tensor shapes
- `/ConstantOfShape`, `/Unsqueeze_*` - prepare input tensor dimensions
- **Should inherit**: Input processing or embedding module tags

#### Parameter Constants 
- `/Constant`, `/Constant_1`, etc. - provide values to other operations
- **Should inherit**: Tag from the operation that consumes these constants

#### Type Conversions
- `/Cast`, `/Cast_1`, `/Cast_2` - convert tensor types for compatibility  
- **Should inherit**: Tag from primary computation operation using the converted tensor

#### Tensor Manipulations
- `/Reshape`, `/Transpose`, `/Concat` - modify tensor shapes
- **Should inherit**: Tag from the module operation that requires the specific shape

### Proposed Data Flow Analysis Strategy

#### 1. **Producer-Consumer Mapping**
```python
graph_context = {
    'tensor_producers': {},  # tensor_name -> node_name
    'tensor_consumers': {},  # tensor_name -> [node_names]
    'node_tags': {},         # node_name -> tag  
    'input_tensors': set(),  # Model input tensor names
}
```

#### 2. **Context Inheritance Priority**
1. **Producer Inheritance**: If auxiliary operation consumes from tagged operation
2. **Consumer Inheritance**: If auxiliary operation feeds into tagged operation  
3. **Input Pattern Matching**: Special handling for input preprocessing
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Most common tag (current approach)

#### 3. **Auxiliary Operation Classification**
```python
AUXILIARY_OPERATION_TYPES = {
    "infrastructure": ["Shape", "Size", "ConstantOfShape"],
    "constants": ["Constant"], 
    "type_conversion": ["Cast", "CastLike"],
    "tensor_manipulation": ["Reshape", "Transpose", "Unsqueeze", "Squeeze"],
    "preprocessing": ["Slice", "Gather", "Where", "Equal"]
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Graph Context Building
- Implement complete producer-consumer relationship mapping
- Identify tagged vs untagged operations  
- Map model input tensors and preprocessing chains

### Phase 2: Context Inheritance Logic
- Producer inheritance: auxiliary operations inherit from operations that feed them
- Consumer inheritance: auxiliary operations inherit from operations they feed
- Multi-level inheritance: trace through multiple hops when needed

### Phase 3: Validation and Testing
- Test with BERT-tiny to verify improved semantic accuracy
- Ensure 100% coverage is maintained
- Validate performance impact is minimal
- Test with other model architectures

## Expected Improvements

### Before (Iteration 1):
```
/Shape              â†’ /BertModel/Embeddings/WordEmbeddings
/Constant_3         â†’ /BertModel/Embeddings/WordEmbeddings  
/Reshape            â†’ /BertModel/Embeddings/WordEmbeddings
/Cast               â†’ /BertModel/Embeddings/WordEmbeddings
```

### After (Iteration 2 Goal):
```
/Shape              â†’ /BertModel/BertEmbeddings (input preprocessing)
/Constant_3         â†’ /BertModel/Encoder/Layer.0/Attention/Self/Query (feeds attention)
/Reshape            â†’ /BertModel/Encoder/Layer.1/Output/Dense (shape for dense layer)
/Cast               â†’ /BertModel/Pooler/Dense (type conversion for pooler)
```
