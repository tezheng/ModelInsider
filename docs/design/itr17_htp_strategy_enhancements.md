## Technical Implementation

### Key Performance Improvements

#### 1. Tag Injection Optimization (Primary Bottleneck - 44.1%)
**Before:**
```python
# Multiple passes over tag_mapping
tagged_operations = len([node for node in self._tag_mapping.values() if node.get('tags')])
unique_tags = len(set(tag for node in self._tag_mapping.values() for tag in node.get('tags', [])))
tag_statistics = self._compute_tag_statistics()  # Another full pass
```

**After:**
```python
# Single-pass computation
tagged_operations = 0
all_tags = []
for node_info in self._tag_mapping.values():
    tags = node_info.get('tags', [])
    if tags:
        tagged_operations += 1
        all_tags.extend(tags)

# Efficient counting with Counter
tag_statistics = dict(Counter(all_tags))
unique_tags_count = len(tag_statistics)
```

#### 2. HuggingFace Architecture Detection
```python
def detect_transformer_architecture(model) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    model_class_name = model.__class__.__name__.lower()
    
    if 'bert' in model_class_name:
        return {
            'is_transformer': True,
            'model_type': 'bert',
            'optimization_hints': ['cache_attention_patterns', 'batch_layer_operations']
        }
    elif 'resnet' in model_class_name:
        return {
            'model_type': 'resnet',
            'optimization_hints': ['cache_conv_patterns', 'batch_block_operations']
        }
```

#### 3. Optimization Framework
```python
def apply_htp_optimizations(exporter):
    # Replace methods with optimized versions
    exporter._inject_builtin_tags_into_onnx = optimized_tag_injection
    exporter._profiler = HTPPerformanceProfiler()
    return exporter
```
