# Iteration 5: Graph Filtering Safety Validation

**Date:** 2025-06-26  
**Goal:** Validate that graph filtering by hierarchy tags doesn't create malformed graphs  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

## Objectives

1. **Graph Filtering Safety**: Ensure filtering ONNX graphs by tags produces valid, executable graphs
2. **Connectivity Validation**: Verify that filtered subgraphs maintain proper input-output relationships
3. **Execution Testing**: Test that filtered graphs can be loaded and executed without errors
4. **Edge Case Coverage**: Test filtering with various tag combinations and auxiliary operations

## Background and Critical Importance

### 🎯 **Core Problem from User Feedback**

The user originally identified this as the **critical issue** with auxiliary operations having empty tags:

> *"Assuming I am filtering onnx graph with a certain tag, nodes with empty tag will be ignored, and causing malformed graph, right?"*

### **Why This is Critical**

**Graph Filtering Use Cases** (from user):
1. **Semantic Structure Analysis**: Filter subgraphs to understand model structure
2. **Subgraph Evaluation/Optimization**: Extract and optimize specific model components  
3. **Partial Model Manipulation**: Modify only portions of the ONNX model

**Safety Requirements**:
- **No Broken Dependencies**: Filtered graphs must maintain valid input-output chains
- **Executable Results**: Filtered subgraphs should be loadable and runnable
- **Semantic Correctness**: Filter results should represent meaningful model components

### Background from Previous Iterations

#### ✅ **Problem Solved**: 100% Coverage Achieved
- **Iteration 1**: Fixed auxiliary operations regression (31 → 0 empty tags)
- **Iteration 2**: Enhanced context inheritance (23% semantic accuracy)
- **Iteration 3**: Universal compatibility validation (50% context inheritance)
- **Iteration 4**: Performance validation (optimal performance confirmed)

#### 🎯 **Iteration 5 Focus**: Safety Validation

Now that we have **100% coverage** and **50% context inheritance**, we need to validate that:
1. **Graph filtering by tags works correctly**
2. **Filtered subgraphs are valid and executable**
3. **Different filtering strategies produce expected results**
4. **Edge cases are handled properly**

## Graph Filtering Safety Analysis Plan

### Phase 1: Graph Filtering Implementation
1. **Create graph filtering utilities** for extracting subgraphs by tag patterns
2. **Implement connectivity analysis** to ensure valid input-output relationships
3. **Add validation functions** to check graph integrity after filtering
4. **Create test framework** for systematic filtering validation

### Phase 2: Safety Validation Testing
1. **Basic filtering tests** with simple tag patterns
2. **Auxiliary operations filtering** to validate our enhanced tagging
3. **Complex filtering scenarios** with multiple tags and nested hierarchies
4. **Edge case testing** with boundary conditions and unusual patterns

### Phase 3: Execution Validation
1. **ONNX model loading** of filtered subgraphs
2. **Execution testing** with appropriate inputs
3. **Output validation** to ensure filtered graphs produce expected results
4. **Performance impact** assessment of filtering operations

## Graph Filtering Strategies to Test

### Strategy 1: **Single Tag Filtering**
- Filter graph to include only operations with specific tag
- Example: Extract only `/BertModel/Embeddings/WordEmbeddings` operations
- **Safety concern**: Ensure input dependencies are preserved

### Strategy 2: **Hierarchical Tag Filtering**  
- Filter by tag prefixes or hierarchical patterns
- Example: Extract all `/BertModel/Encoder/*` operations
- **Safety concern**: Maintain hierarchical relationships and boundaries

### Strategy 3: **Multi-Tag Filtering**
- Include operations matching multiple tag patterns
- Example: Embeddings + first attention layer
- **Safety concern**: Ensure cohesive subgraph with valid connections

### Strategy 4: **Auxiliary Operations Inclusion**
- Test how auxiliary operations affect filtering results
- Example: Include auxiliary operations that support filtered components
- **Safety concern**: Ensure auxiliary operations don't break graph connectivity

## Safety Validation Test Cases

### Test Case 1: **Basic Connectivity Preservation**
```python
# Filter: Operations tagged with "/CustomAuxiliaryTestModel/Embedding"
# Expected: Subgraph with embedding operations + required auxiliary operations
# Validation: Input tensors → embedding → output tensors (valid chain)
```

### Test Case 2: **Auxiliary Operations Dependencies**
```python
# Filter: Linear layer operations only
# Expected: Include required Constant/MatMul auxiliary operations 
# Validation: Filtered graph includes all necessary auxiliary operations
```

### Test Case 3: **Cross-Module Dependencies**
```python
# Filter: First layer only
# Expected: Handle cross-module connections gracefully
# Validation: Either include dependencies or create valid input boundaries
```

### Test Case 4: **Complex Hierarchical Filtering**
```python
# Filter: Multiple hierarchy levels with different patterns
# Expected: Coherent subgraph respecting hierarchical relationships
# Validation: No orphaned operations or broken dependency chains
```
