# Iteration 3: Multi-Architecture Testing for Universal Compatibility

**Date:** 2025-06-26  
**Goal:** Test auxiliary operations tagging with multiple model architectures for universal validation  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

## Objectives

1. **Universal Validation**: Test the auxiliary operations solution across different model architectures
2. **Architecture Diversity**: Validate with CNN (ResNet), Transformer (BERT), and other architectures  
3. **Performance Consistency**: Ensure consistent performance across different model types
4. **Edge Case Discovery**: Identify any architecture-specific issues or limitations

## Background from Previous Iterations

### ✅ Iteration 1 Success: Fixed Critical Regression
- **Root cause**: HTP builtin tracking bypassed complete coverage
- **Solution**: Added auxiliary operations tagging with fallback strategy
- **Result**: 100% coverage (31/31 auxiliary operations tagged in BERT-tiny)

### ✅ Iteration 2 Success: Enhanced Context Inheritance  
- **Improvement**: Data flow analysis for semantic accuracy
- **BERT-tiny results**: 7/31 operations (23%) got context-specific tags
- **SimpleCNN results**: 2/3 operations (66%) got context-specific tags  
- **Performance**: ~4s completion, no timeout issues

### 🎯 Iteration 3 Focus: Universal Architecture Testing

The solution works well for BERT and SimpleCNN, but we need to validate:
1. **Different architectures**: ResNet, GPT, ViT, custom models
2. **Varying graph complexity**: Simple vs complex computational graphs
3. **Different auxiliary operation patterns**: Different ONNX export characteristics
