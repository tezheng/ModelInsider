Test Performance Benchmarks - Comprehensive Performance Testing Suite

This test suite validates the performance characteristics of the modelexport system,
ensuring efficient resource usage, reasonable export times, and scalable behavior
across different model sizes and usage patterns.

Performance Testing Philosophy:
    Performance is a critical aspect of the modelexport system that directly impacts
    user experience. This test suite establishes performance baselines, detects
    regressions, and validates that the system scales appropriately with model
    complexity. Performance testing covers multiple dimensions:
