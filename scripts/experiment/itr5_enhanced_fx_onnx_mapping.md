# Iteration 5: Enhanced FX→ONNX Mapping Accuracy

**Goal**: Improve mapping accuracy with sophisticated pattern matching and confidence scoring
**Implementation**: Enhanced `_map_fx_to_onnx_nodes()` with multiple strategies

## Key Improvements
- ✅ Multi-pattern operation matching with confidence scores
- ✅ Enhanced operation correspondence (LayerNorm → 9 ONNX ops, etc.)
- ✅ Execution order analysis and data flow understanding
- ✅ Post-processing validation and improvement
- ✅ Semantic matching for low-confidence mappings
- ✅ Pattern similarity scoring with flexibility options

## Technical Features
- **Strategy 1**: Enhanced patterns with primary/secondary operations and flexible matching
- **Strategy 2**: FX execution order analysis for better alignment
- **Strategy 3**: Confidence-based mapping with lookahead and validation
- **Strategy 4**: Post-processing to improve low-confidence mappings and remove very poor ones

## Test Results (Improved)
- ✅ Simple Model: Working (2 hierarchy nodes, Linear detection improved)
- ✅ torch.nn Filtering: Working perfectly (4 hierarchy paths, proper filtering)
- ✅ FX Graph Analysis: Working (42.9% coverage, 3 nodes mapped with better accuracy)
- ❌ BERT Model: Still failing (FX fundamental limitation confirmed)

## Mapping Improvements
- Enhanced pattern recognition for complex operations (LayerNorm decomposition)
- Confidence scoring helps identify and improve weak mappings
- Semantic matching provides fallback for unknown patterns
- Better handling of operation expansion (1 FX node → multiple ONNX nodes)

## Discovery
Enhanced mapping shows clear improvements in accuracy and coverage for traceable models. The confidence scoring system successfully identifies areas for improvement.

## Next Steps
1. Test with different model architectures (ResNet, Vision Transformers, etc.)
2. Optimize performance with larger models
3. Implement hybrid fallback to HTP for untraceable models
