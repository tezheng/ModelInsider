# Iteration 3: CLI Integration and Testing Infrastructure

**Goal**: Integrate FX exporter with CLI and create comprehensive testing
**Implementation**: Modified CLI to support 'fx_graph' strategy, created test script

## CLI Integration Changes
- ✅ Added 'fx_graph' to strategy choices
- ✅ Added FXHierarchyExporter import
- ✅ Added conditional logic to use FX exporter for fx_graph strategy
- ✅ Updated result output to handle FX-specific return fields
- ✅ Added example usage in help text

## Test Script Features
- ✅ Test 1: Simple PyTorch model (MUST-003 universal design)
- ✅ Test 2: BERT model with instance path validation (R12)
- ✅ Test 3: torch.nn filtering validation (CARDINAL RULE #2)
- ✅ Test 4: FX graph analysis capabilities
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and cleanup
- ✅ Validation of all major requirements

## Next Steps
1. Run test script to validate implementation
2. Fix any issues found during testing
3. Enhance FX→ONNX mapping accuracy
