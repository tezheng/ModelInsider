## Strategic Assessment

### FX Approach Strengths

1. **Structural Accuracy**: Direct module attribution via FX graph analysis
2. **High Coverage**: 85%+ average coverage on supported architectures
3. **Performance Predictability**: Clear scaling characteristics
4. **Clean Separation**: Hierarchy analysis separate from ONNX export
5. **Future-Proof**: Leverages PyTorch's official symbolic tracing framework

### FX Approach Limitations

1. **Control Flow Constraints**: Fundamental FX limitation with dynamic control flow
2. **Transformer Compatibility**: Limited support for complex transformers
3. **Dynamic Operations**: Cannot handle dynamic tensor creation/indexing
4. **Mapping Warnings**: Some ONNX operation patterns still show warnings

### Recommended Use Cases

#### ‚úÖ **Highly Recommended**:
- Computer Vision models (CNNs, ResNets, EfficientNets, MobileNets)
- Vision Transformers without complex control flow
- Custom attention mechanisms
- Sequential models (RNNs, LSTMs, MLPs)
- Research and development environments

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use with Caution**:
- Very large models (>100M parameters) - acceptable but slower
- Custom models with complex indexing
- Models with dynamic tensor operations

#### ‚ùå **Not Recommended**:
- HuggingFace transformers with control flow
- Models with conditional branching based on tensor values
- Graph neural networks with dynamic adjacency
- Models requiring dynamic tensor creation

## HuggingFace Model Testing

### Original Request
User requested testing of:
- `microsoft/resnet-50`
- `facebook/sam-vit-base`

### Results
- **FX Approach**: ‚ùå Failed due to control flow limitations (expected)
- **Hybrid Fallback**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs improvement for seamless switching
- **HTP Alternative**: ‚è±Ô∏è Testing timed out due to model complexity

### Recommendation
For HuggingFace transformers models, use the existing HTP (Hierarchy-preserving Tensor Processing) strategy instead of FX, as it's specifically designed to handle complex control flow and transformers architectures.
