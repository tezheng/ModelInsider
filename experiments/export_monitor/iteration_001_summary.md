# Iteration 1 Summary - Export Monitor Improvements

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Module Hierarchy Tree Display
**Issue**: Module hierarchy was only showing 4 lines instead of the full tree structure.
**Cause**: The tree building logic couldn't handle module names containing dots (e.g., "layer.0").
**Fix**: Implemented a proper parent-child mapping that looks for the longest matching parent path instead of parsing dots.

### 2. Fixed Complete HF Hierarchy with ONNX Nodes Display  
**Issue**: The ONNX nodes hierarchy was truncated at 12 lines instead of 30+.
**Cause**: Same issue as above - incorrect child detection logic for paths with dots in component names.
**Fix**: Applied the same parent-child mapping approach and increased the display limit from 30 to 50 lines.

## Results
- Console output increased from 129 lines to 169 lines (baseline: 163 lines)
- Output similarity improved from 0% to 71.5% 
- All 8 export steps are now properly displayed
- Hierarchy trees show full nested structure

## Remaining Differences from Baseline
1. File paths differ (temp/baseline vs experiments/export_monitor)
2. Some minor formatting differences in ONNX node display
3. Execution times vary slightly

## Next Steps for Iteration 2
1. Start refactoring to remove hardcoded values
2. Extract magic numbers/strings to configuration
3. Replace print() with rich console methods
4. Check metadata and report outputs match baseline
