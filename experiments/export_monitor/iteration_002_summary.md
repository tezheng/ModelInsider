# Iteration 2 Summary - Export Monitor Refactoring

## Refactoring Applied

### 1. Created HTPExportConfig Class
- Extracted all hardcoded values (80, 60, 30, etc.) to configuration constants
- Added formatting templates for consistent messages
- Created centralized icon/emoji configuration
- Made all display limits configurable

### 2. Replaced print() with Rich Console
- All HTPConsoleWriter methods now use rich console print
- Proper style support for colored output
- Width control through console configuration

### 3. Improved Code Organization
- No more magic numbers scattered throughout the code
- All configuration in one place (HTPExportConfig)
- Better separation of concerns

## Results
- Console output similarity: 70.0%
- All hardcoded values extracted
- Rich console integration complete
- Code is more maintainable and configurable

## Next Steps for Iteration 3
1. Test with actual HTP exporter to ensure compatibility
2. Compare metadata and report outputs with baseline
3. Further improve message formatting using rich features
4. Add more configuration options if needed
